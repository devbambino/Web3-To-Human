# Web3-To-Human v1
Simplifying Web3 and blockchain for Spanish-speaking users in Latin America with AI-powered articles, explained in easy-to-understand language and stored on the blockchain for free access by all.

With Web3 To Human, our goal is to bridge the knowledge gap around Web3 and blockchain for Spanish-speaking users, making complex technologies accessible in their native language. This project is not just about education‚Äîit‚Äôs about empowering Latin Americans with the tools and knowledge to actively participate in the growing Web3 space. I believe Web3 can open doors for financial inclusion, innovation, and economic empowerment in LATAM, and I want to be part of that transformation.

## Features
Here's what it offers:

- ü™Ñ **Web3 to easy to understand language translation:** The app transforms technical Web3 content into simplified articles in Spanish and english using AI. 

- **Gas Less Transactions:** Using Coinbase's paymaster capabilities the app allows gas less transactions for Coinbase wallet users. 

- **Charging for Using AI:** In order to avoid bots to abuse the app we decided to charge 0.00007 ETH, equivalent to less than 20 cents. We are planning to reduce this amount in the future when the app goes to production and Mainnet. 

- **Blockchain Storage:** Articles are stored on the blockchain, making them accessible for free to future users. 

- **Educational Features:** Each article contains a title, tags, explanations, key points, and FAQs designed to break down complex topics, and help new users to break into the wonderful web3 world.

- üß† **Powered by Gemini Pro:** Leverages advanced AI capabilities for top-notch content quality.

- üõ°Ô∏è **Committed to Responsible AI:** We've implemented safety measures to prevent our AI from generating harmful content. This includes filtering for categories like harassment, hate speech, sexually explicit material, and dangerous suggestions.

- üíª **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a user-friendly experience across all devices.

## How to use it

`GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key_here"`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_API_KEY="your_key_here"`

## Troubleshooting & Know Issues

**App Reloading:** The first time you open the app, if you connect your wallet using the Coinbase wallet option then when you click "Get Random Explanation" button the apps get reloaded. This is a weird behaviour I didn't have time to fix. For avoiding this issue the first time you open the app simply connect your Coinbase wallet and then follow the "Pay & Get Explanation" flow which is: paste an url in the link field and then click "Pay $0.20 & Get Explanation". After getting the explanation, click "Reset" and from now on the "Get Random Explanation" button will be working properly.

**Web Scraping in Localhost:** The feature generating an explanation from an url is doing web scraping to extract the text from the web page shared. If you are running the app in Localhost then a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue would occur. To fix the issue you would need to use the Firefox web browser and install the extension [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).
