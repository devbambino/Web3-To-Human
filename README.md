# Web3-To-Human v1
Simplifying Web3 and blockchain for Spanish-speaking users in Latin America with AI-powered articles, explained in easy-to-understand language and stored on the blockchain for free access by all.

With Web3 To Human, our goal is to bridge the knowledge gap around Web3 and blockchain for Spanish-speaking users, making complex technologies accessible in their native language. This project is not just about education‚Äîit‚Äôs about empowering Latin Americans with the tools and knowledge to actively participate in the growing Web3 space. I believe Web3 can open doors for financial inclusion, innovation, and economic empowerment in LATAM, and I want to be part of that transformation.

## How to use it

### Install all the dependencies
`npm install`

### Create .env in root
Include your Google Gemini API key and all CDP related keys there with the variable name: 
`GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key_here"`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_API_KEY="your_key_here"`

## Troubleshooting

The feature generating a post from an url is doing web scraping to extract the text from the web page shared. If you are running the app in Localhost then a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue would occur. To fix the issue you would need to use the Firefox web browser and install the extension [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).

## Tech behind

This app is connecting to Base Sepolia blockchain and is using Google AI API for connecting to Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM.
